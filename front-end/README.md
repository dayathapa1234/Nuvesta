# Nuvesta Frontend

This React + TypeScript application was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vite.dev) and uses Tailwind CSS with components from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app queries `/api/paginatedSymbols` and provides searching and filtering for symbols.
